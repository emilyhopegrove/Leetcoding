###
 #       Explanation:

#	1.	Initialize k: k is used as a pointer to place the next non-val element.
#	2.	Iterate Through nums: Loop through each element in nums.
#	â€¢	If the current element is not equal to val, place it at the position k and increment k.
#	3.	Return k: After the loop, k will be the count of elements that are not equal to val, and the first k elements of nums will be the elements that are not equal to val.
